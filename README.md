# Superstore Sales Analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis using real-world business data from the [Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final). The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help improve business profitabilityâ€”such as identifying underperforming regions, understanding discount strategies, and analyzing product-level profit drivers.

I used **Python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **SQL** to clean, transform, analyze and visualize the dataset. The data was split into multiple relational tables to simulate a more realistic database environment.

Key aspects of this project include:
- Data cleaning and preparation for SQL integration
- Complex SQL queries with CTEs and window functions
- Customer and product-level profitability analysis
- Regional performance breakdown
- Strategy-focused insights on how to improve profit
